# tarry

    npm install --save tarry

See [`index.d.ts`](index.d.ts) or [`index.ts`](index.ts) for "documentation" (sorry).

This package used to be called `arrays`, installed via GitHub, then I tried out npm's `@chbrown` scope thing, which was kind of unwieldy. Better just to use a strange-ish name than deal with those issues. So, `arrays` → `@chbrown/arrays` → ~`typedarrays`~ → ~`typedarray`~ → ~`tarray`~ → `tarry`.
